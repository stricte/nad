# librespot-sender-receiver

## Overview

This project consists of two essential components:

- `sender.py`: This script is designed to be run alongside librespot for event tracking.

- `receiver.py`: It consumes events generated by `sender.py` and communicates with the NAD amplifier via an RS232 port.

## How it Works

1. **Event Tracking**: Start `sender.py` alongside your librespot setup to track events.

2. **Communication with NAD Amplifier**: `receiver.py` takes the events tracked by `sender.py` and handles the communication with your NAD amplifier. The communication between `receiver.py` and the NAD amplifier is established through an RS232 port.

## Getting Started
